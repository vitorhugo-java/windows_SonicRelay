# Non-admin release smoke test

Run this checklist before approving every Windows Publisher release. All mandatory steps must pass from a clean, standard user account. A failure cannot be waived by running as administrator or by changing the machine globally.

## Test record

- Release/tag:
- ZIP filename:
- Commit from `BUILD-INFO.txt`:
- Windows edition and version:
- Account type (must be standard user):
- Managed/corporate device policy, if applicable:
- Tester and date:

## Preconditions

- [ ] Sign in with a standard user account that cannot approve elevation with its own credentials.
- [ ] Confirm SonicRelay is not installed, no SonicRelay Windows service exists, and no previous `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SonicRelay\WindowsPublisher` folder remains.
- [ ] Use a normal user-writable folder such as `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads` or `%USERPROFILE%\Desktop`; do not use Program Files.
- [ ] Keep Task Manager available to inspect processes. Do not pre-create firewall rules, install drivers, or install a machine-wide runtime.

## Download and extract the portable ZIP

- [ ] Open GitHub Releases and download `SonicRelay.WindowsPublisher-win-x64-<version>.zip` without elevation.
- [ ] Confirm the ZIP name matches the release version and `BUILD-INFO.txt` identifies the expected version, commit, and `win-x64` runtime.
- [ ] Extract the ZIP into the selected user-writable folder using Windows Explorer.
- [ ] Confirm extraction neither shows an administrator prompt nor requires writing to Program Files.
- [ ] Confirm there is no installer to run and extraction does not install a Windows service or drivers.

## Start and configure

- [ ] Run `SonicRelay.Windows.App.exe` directly from the extracted folder without **Run as administrator**.
- [ ] Confirm startup does not show an administrator prompt, request firewall rules, install a service, install drivers, or modify a protected machine location.
- [ ] Confirm the main window opens and remains responsive.
- [ ] Open Settings and confirm the current configuration is displayed.
- [ ] Configure the backend URL with a valid absolute HTTP(S) test address, save it, close the app, reopen it, and confirm the value persists.
- [ ] Confirm `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SonicRelay\WindowsPublisher\appsettings.json` is created or updated and no runtime data is written beside the executable or under Program Files.

## Authentication and local state

- [ ] Enter test credentials and attempt login. Record success or the expected typed authentication/backend error; the app must remain responsive.
- [ ] When credentials are accepted, confirm tokens are stored at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SonicRelay\WindowsPublisher\tokens.dat` for the current user and are not readable as plaintext.
- [ ] Use the application's reset/sign-out behavior to clear local tokens and configuration. If the current build exposes clearing through separate controls, exercise both and record them.
- [ ] Confirm cleared token/config files are removed or reset only under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SonicRelay\WindowsPublisher` and the app can start again.

## Failure handling

- [ ] Set the backend URL to an unused or unreachable address and attempt login. Confirm the missing backend produces a clear, non-fatal error without elevation, repeated modal prompts, or a crash.
- [ ] Disable or disconnect available audio endpoints, then exercise the audio-device/publish path. Confirm a missing audio device produces a clear, non-fatal unavailable-device state without requesting a driver or elevation.
- [ ] Restore the test environment and confirm the app can be closed normally with no SonicRelay process or service left running.

## Release gate

The release is blocked if any mandatory checkbox fails, if any administrator prompt appears, or if the app requires Program Files, a Windows service, drivers, firewall rules, protected registry/filesystem writes, or machine-wide dependencies. Missing backend and missing audio device scenarios pass only when the app reports the condition gracefully and remains usable.

For every failure, capture the failed step, artifact version, Windows/account details, exact visible message, and relevant user-scoped diagnostic output. Do not include credentials or tokens. Fix the problem and rerun the entire checklist from the clean standard-user preconditions before releasing.

## Cleanup

- [ ] Close the app and delete the extracted folder without elevation.
- [ ] Delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SonicRelay\WindowsPublisher` and confirm cleanup needs no administrator prompt.
- [ ] Record the final result as **PASS** only when every mandatory item above passes; otherwise record **BLOCKED** with the failure evidence.
